	isbn = {978-0-226-43608-1},
	abstract = {An instant classic when first published in 1991, How to Lie with Maps revealed how the choices mapmakers make—consciously or unconsciously—mean that every map inevitably presents only one of many possible stories about the places it depicts. The principles Mark Monmonier outlined back then remain true today, despite significant technological changes in the making and use of maps. The introduction and spread of digital maps and mapping software, however, have added new wrinkles to the ever-evolving landscape of modern mapmaking.  ​Fully updated for the digital age, this new edition of How to Lie with Maps examines the myriad ways that technology offers new opportunities for cartographic mischief, deception, and propaganda. While retaining the same brevity, range, and humor as its predecessors, this third edition includes significant updates throughout as well as new chapters on image maps, prohibitive cartography, and online maps. It also includes an expanded section of color images and an updated list of sources for further reading.},

Looks at the evidence for the Earth's very early differentiation into core, mantle, crust, atmosphere and oceans and how this differentiation saw extreme interactions within the Earth system.  Discusses Archaean Earth processes within the framework of the Earth System Science paradigm, providing a qualitative assessment of the principal reservoirs and fluxes in the early Earth.   “The book would be perfect for a graduate-level or upper level undergraduate course on the early Earth.

Without volcanic activity, life as we know it would not exist on our planet. Although beautiful to behold, volcanoes are also potentially destructive, and understanding their nature is critical to prevent major loss of life in the future. Richly illustrated with over 300 original color photographs and diagrams the book is written in an informal manner, with minimum use of jargon, and relies heavily on first-person, eye-witness accounts of eruptive activity at both "red" (effusive) and "grey" (explosive) volcanoes to illustrate the full spectrum of volcanic processes and their products. Decades of teaching in university classrooms and fieldwork on active volcanoes throughout the world have provided the authors with unique experiences that they have distilled into a highly readable textbook of lasting value. Questions for Thought, Study, and Discussion, Suggestions for Further Reading, and a comprehensive list of source references make this work a major resource for further study of volcanology. Volcanoes maintains three core foci: Global perspectives explain volcanoes in terms of their tectonic positions on Earth and their roles in earth history Environmental perspectives describe the essential role of volcanism in the moderation of terrestrial climate and atmosphere Humanitarian perspectives discuss the major influences of volcanoes on human societies. This latter is especially important as resource scarcities and environmental issues loom over our world, and as increasing numbers of people are threatened by volcanic hazards Readership Volcanologists, advanced undergraduate, and graduate students in earth science and related degree courses, and volcano enthusiasts worldwide.

With this edition, the authors seek to answer two central questions, How does the planet work? and Why is this important to know? By discussing the unifying theory of plate tectonics in detail early in the text, the authors are able to link diverse material by this common thread, providing a global perspective of Earth and allowing students to recognize seemingly unrelated geologic phenomena as a continuum of interrelated events within a complete planetary system. In addition to providing students with an understanding of geology and its processes, the authors consistently demonstrate how geology relates to the human experience. By asking the question What would you do? throughout the text, students are encouraged to explore their reactions to particular situations. New Geology in Your Life sections address relevant student concerns, particularly in the areas of environment and energy. And a new penultimate chapter on Resources and the Fate of the Earth ties together many of the concepts of particular interest to students. This edition is fully integrated with the online student tutorial system Physical {GeologyNow}. Physical {GeologyNow} uses a series of chapter-specific diagnostic tests to build a personalized learning plan for each student, allowing students to focus their study time on specific areas of weaknesses.

The book’s purpose is to clearly present geologic processes so that students can understand the logic of scientific methods. This text features an outstanding art program and a proven, accessible writing style.},

	abstract = {"Earth is a very small part of a vast universe, but it is our home. It provides the resources that support our modern society and the ingredients necessary to maintain life. Knowledge of our physical environment is critical to our well-being and vital to our survival. A basic geology course can help a person gain such an understanding. It can also take advantage of the interest and curiosity many of us have about our planet--its landscapes and the processes that create and alter them. The eleventh edition of Earth: An Introduction to Physical Geology, like its predecessors, is a college-level text that is intended to be a meaningful, non-technical survey for students taking their first course in geology. In addition to being informative and up-to-date, a major goal of Earth is to meet the need of students for a readable and user-friendly text, a book that is a highly usable "tool" for learning the basic principles and concepts of geology"--Provided by publisher.},

	isbn = {978-0-07-809516-0},
	abstract = {Stephen Reynolds, author of the highly successful Exploring Geology, brings his ground-breaking, visually spectacular approach to Exploring Physical Geography. Intended for an introductory geography course, such as Physical Geography, Reynolds  Exploring Physical Geography promotes inquiry and science as an active process. It encourages student curiosity and aims to activate existing student knowledge by posing the title of every two-page spread and every subsection as a question. In addition, questions are dispersed throughout the book. Integrated into the book are opportunities for students to observe patterns, features, and examples before the underlying concepts are explained. That is, we employ a learning-cycle approach where student exploration precedes the introduction of geographic terms and the application of knowledge to a new situation. Exploring Physical Geography introduces terms after students have an opportunity to observe the feature or concept that is being named. This approach is consistent with several educational philosophies, including a learning cycle and just-in-time teaching. Research on learning cycles shows that students are more likely to retain a term if they already have a mental image of the thing being named (Lawson, 2003). Also, the figure-based approach in this book allows terms to be introduced in their context rather than as a definition that is detached from a visual representation of the term. We introduce new terms in italics rather than in boldface, because boldfaced terms on a textbook page cause students to immediately focus mostly on the terms, rather than build an understanding of the concepts. Featuring more than 2,500 photographs and illustration, Exploring Physical Geography engages students with strong visuals, unique two-page spreads, and Before You Leave This Page objectives.},

They are now standard features in a wide range of languages and popular tools, including Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, {VB}.{NET} and C\# (and any language using the .{NET} Framework), {PHP}, and {MySQL}.  If you don't use regular expressions yet, you will discover in this book a whole new world of mastery over your data. If you already use them, you'll appreciate this book's unprecedented detail and breadth of coverage. If you think you know all you need to know about regular expressions, this book is a stunning eye-opener.  As this book shows, a command of regular expressions is an invaluable skill. Regular expressions allow you to code complex and subtle text processing that you never imagined could be automated. Regular expressions can save you time and aggravation. They can be used to craft elegant solutions to a wide range of problems. Once you've mastered regular expressions, they'll become an invaluable part of your toolkit. You will wonder how you ever got by without them.  Yet despite their wide availability, flexibility, and unparalleled power, regular expressions are frequently underutilized. Yet what is power in the hands of an expert can be fraught with peril for the unwary. Mastering Regular Expressions will help you navigate the minefield to becoming an expert and help you optimize your use of regular expressions.   Mastering Regular Expressions, Third Edition, now includes a full chapter devoted to {PHP} and its powerful and expressive suite of regular expression functions, in addition to enhanced {PHP} coverage in the central "core" chapters. Furthermore, this edition has been updated throughout to reflect advances in other languages, including expanded in-depth coverage of Sun's java.util.regex package, which has emerged as the standard Java regex implementation.Topics include: A comparison of features among different versions of many languages and tools How the regular expression engine works Optimization (major savings available here!) Matching just what you want, but not what you don't want Sections and chapters on individual languages  Written in the lucid, entertaining tone that makes a complex, dry topic become crystal-clear to programmers, and sprinkled with solutions to complex real-world problems, Mastering Regular Expressions, Third Edition offers a wealth information that you can put to immediate use. Reviews of this new edition and the second edition: "There isn't a better (or more useful) book available on regular expressions."  --Zak Greant, Managing Director, {eZ} Systems  "A real tour-de-force of a book which not only covers the mechanics of regexes in extraordinary detail but also talks about efficiency and the use of regexes in Perl, Java, and .{NET}...If you use regular expressions as part of your professional work (even if you already have a good book on whatever language you're programming in) I would strongly recommend this book to you."  --Dr. Chris Brown, Linux Format   "The author does an outstanding job leading the reader from regex novice to master. The book is extremely easy to read and chock full of useful and relevant examples...Regular expressions are valuable tools that every developer should have in their toolbox. Mastering Regular Expressions is the definitive guide to the subject, and an outstanding resource that belongs on every programmer's bookshelf. Ten out of Ten Horseshoes."  --Jason Menard, Java Ranch},
